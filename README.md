Parts needed:

RaspberryPi, Model B (not plus) - http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/ <br>
RaspberryPi camera module - http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/ <br>
PiTFT - 2.8" TFT touch screen  - http://www.adafruit.com/product/1601 <br>
Mini Thermal printer - http://www.adafruit.com/product/597 <br>
BPA-Free thermal paper (see warning below) <br>
2 or 3 cell Lipo battery, somewhere between 1000 and 2000mah. <br>
Switching power regulator, like the LM2596HV<br>
<br>
Total cost is about $100<br>
<br>
This project is a work-in-progress. Expect things to not fit perfectly and tinkering is required to get it going.<br>
<br>
The code was based on Adafruit's camera example<br>

Follow tutorial to install camera libraries.<br>
<br>
And AdaFruit's thermal paper printer<br>
https://learn.adafruit.com/pi-thermal-printer<br>
Follow tutorial to intall printer libraries.<br>
<br>
About the battery, I used a beefy 3 cell 2000mah bettery, and the camera would run for 3-4 hours off that. The design does not include any method to charge the battery, so you might want to add that or get a lipo charger.
<br><br>
WARNING - Regular Thermal paper contains insane amounts of Bisphenol-A, which is an Endocrine Disruptor. This is especially bad for young children. Please invest in some BPA-free thermal paper. They do exist.

Have fun !
