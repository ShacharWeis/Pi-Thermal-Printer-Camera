Parts needed:

RaspberryPi, Model B (not plus) - http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/
RaspberryPi camera module - http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module/
PiTFT - 2.8" TFT touch screen  - http://www.adafruit.com/product/1601
Mini Thermal printer - http://www.adafruit.com/product/597
BPA-Free thermal paper (see warning below)
2 or 3 cell Lipo battery, somewhere between 1000 and 2000mah. 
Switching power regulator, like the LM2596HV

Total cost is about $100

This project is a work-in-progress. Expect things to not fit perfectly and tinkering is required to get it going.
The code was based on Adafruit's camera example - https://learn.adafruit.com/diy-wifi-raspberry-pi-touch-cam/pi-setup
Follow that tutorial to install camera libraries.

About the battery, I used a beefy 3 cell 2000mah bettery, and the camera would run for 3-4 hours off that. The design does not include any method to charge the battery, so you might want to add that or get a lipo charger.

WARNING - Regular Thermal paper contains insane amounts of Bisphenol-A, which is an Endocrine Disruptor. This is especially bad for young children. Please invest in some BPA-free thermal paper. They do exist.

Have fun !
